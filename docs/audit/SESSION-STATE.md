# Session state

Written so another session can resume without reconstructing anything. Updated at every phase boundary.

---

## Where things stand

| | |
|---|---|
| Canonical repo | `C:\Users\AreenCubs\AreenCUBs-Studio` (source of truth) |
| Branch | `phase-1-data-integrity` |
| Isolated execution clone | `~/AreenCUBs-Studio-staging` inside Ubuntu / WSL 2 (ext4) |
| Local stack | **stopped** unless a phase is actively testing |
| Production contact | **never** — no query, no migration list, no push, no deploy |

**Sync rule:** the WSL clone is only ever a *runner*. Before any database or end-to-end verification, fast-forward it to the exact canonical commit:

```bash
wsl -d Ubuntu -u root -- bash -lc 'cd /root/AreenCUBs-Studio-staging && git fetch origin && git checkout -q <commit>'
```

`node_modules` is never shared between Windows and WSL. If `command -v npm` in WSL returns a `/mnt/c/...` path, the Linux toolchain is not being used.

---

## Infrastructure (already built, do not rebuild)

- WSL 2, Ubuntu, **NAT** networking (`.wslconfig` absent — defaults). Mirrored networking must never be enabled.
- Native **Docker Engine CE** inside Ubuntu, `unix:///var/run/docker.sock`, API never on TCP.
- `/etc/docker/daemon.json` pins `ip` and `default-network-opts.bridge.host_binding_ipv4` to `127.0.0.1`.
- Docker Desktop is installed but **stopped**, and its `daemon.json` was restored from backup. It cannot enforce loopback publishing on Windows — `db:preflight` now fails on it deliberately.

---

## Standing constraints

- Free and open-source only. No purchases, trials, or paid tiers.
- No production connection, remote query, `db push/pull/dump`, deployment, or Vercel change.
- Never read, print, copy or modify the Windows `.env.local`.
- No key, JWT, password or connection string in output, tests, fixtures, docs or Git.
- Synthetic `.invalid` users and fabricated business data only.
- Money module stays disconnected from persistence; financial behaviour unchanged.
- No new roles/permissions without an approved specification. No RLS weakening.
- Stop the stack whenever it is not actively under test.

---

## Resume checklist

```bash
cd /c/Users/AreenCubs/AreenCUBs-Studio
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD     # phase-1-data-integrity
git status --short                  # must be empty
npm run test:run                    # see AUTONOMOUS-PROGRESS.md for the current total
```

Then read, in order:

1. `docs/audit/AUTONOMOUS-PROGRESS.md` — what is done and what is next
2. `docs/audit/DECISIONS-NEEDED.md` — everything blocked on approval
3. `docs/audit/PHASE-0-DISCOVERY.md` — the confirmed issue register
4. `docs/STAGING.md` — how to run the isolated stack

---

## Next steps (in order)

1. **Phase 2d — browser/hydration verification.** Not started.
   - `npm i -D @playwright/test && npx playwright install chromium` (free)
   - Generate ephemeral local Supabase keys from `npm run db:status` into an **ignored** temp env file inside the WSL clone. Never print, never commit, delete afterwards.
   - Cover: synthetic admin login, missing-profile fail-closed, Content OS plan creation, Publishing hydration under UTC-server vs Africa/Tunis-browser, finance pages against the contradiction fixture, navigation and error states.
   - Responsive at mobile / tablet / desktop; focused a11y (keyboard, visible focus, labels, dialogs, contrast).
   - Screenshots must contain fabricated data only.
2. **Phase 2f — dashboard quality audit**, using 2d evidence.

Run database and browser work **only** inside WSL, prove isolation first, stop the stack after.

## Current totals

| | |
|---|---|
| Unit tests | **197** (8 files) — `npm run test:run`, no Docker needed |
| Database tests | **99** (4 files) — `npm run test:db`, requires the WSL stack |
| Build | clean, **52 routes** |
| Typecheck | clean |

## Commits this session

`dae79f2` Phase 2b · `6a7fce7` Phase 2c · Phase 2e (this commit)

## Continuation point (updated)

**HEAD:** see `git log -1`. Branch `phase-1-data-integrity`. Tree clean.

### Safe local preview

```bash
wsl -d Ubuntu
cd ~/AreenCUBs-Studio-staging
npm run preview:local     # isolation gate, synthetic DB, app on 127.0.0.1:3000
npm run preview:stop      # tears down and PROVES it; nonzero if incomplete
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:3000/dashboard**. Synthetic logins (fabricated, local DB only):
`admin` / `worker` / `freelancer`, password `staging-only-not-a-secret`; `orphan` is authenticated with no profile and must be denied.

### Master-brief phase status

| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| 1A `/dashboard/team` hydration | **NOT DONE** — 3 browser failures. Bisection plan in PHASE-2F. |
| 1B accessibility labels | ✅ done (`4438079`), verified in browser |
| 1C contrast / design tokens | **NOT STARTED** — axe reports `color-contrast` on every route |
| 2 role & permission architecture | **NOT STARTED** — DB has 3 roles; commercial/intern/client are greenfield |
| 3 Content OS authorization | interim containment done (`8c21885`); full 6-role model not started |
| 4 commercial dashboard | **NOT STARTED** |
| 5 intern dashboard | **NOT STARTED** |
| 6 client portal | **NOT STARTED** |
| 7 video review + storage provider | **NOT STARTED** |
| 8 optional TVA | module built & tested (`eceab3d`), **not wired**; divergence unapproved |
| 9 task/project operations | existing features only; import workflow not started |
| 10 reporting | **NOT STARTED** |
| 11 design system rollout | **NOT STARTED** |
| 12 safe local preview | ✅ done |

### Recommended next order

1. **Phase 1C contrast** — axe evidence exists, token-level fix, self-contained.
2. **Phase 2 role schema + RLS** — everything from Phase 3 onward depends on it. Start with the permission matrix document, then a forward-only migration adding roles and membership/assignment tables, then RLS tests per role.
3. **Phase 1A hydration** — use production-build component bisection; the dev-server harness failed three times.

Phases 4–7 and 10 are each multi-session features. Do not start one without room to finish and verify it.

## Continuation point — 37a015a

**Program is now persistent.** A session needs only: `Continue.` See `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/audit/MASTER-IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md`.

### In progress: Phase 1 — contrast and semantic design tokens

**Done:** the two largest light-theme offenders fixed at their true source (the light-theme override block in globals.css, NOT the custom properties — a first attempt at the tokens changed nothing, because those elements do not consume them).

- `#6C8298` → `#556575` (30+ nodes; 3.97 → 5.99:1 on white)
- `#1A9DBF` → `#0E6C87` (13 nodes; 2.92 → 5.50:1 on #F0F6FF)

**Next, immediately:** the remaining long tail, each 1–7 nodes, all on light surfaces:

| Pair | Ratio | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `#7c848f` on `#ffffff` | 3.78 | `text-ink/NN` opacity blend |
| `#74767c` on `#f5f9ff` | 4.29 | `text-ink/NN` opacity blend |
| `#f43f5e` on `#feecef` | 3.22 | danger badge |
| `#7dd3fc` on `#e1f5fe` | 1.48 | info badge |
| `#22c55e` on `#ffffff` | 2.27 | success (24px, needs 3:1) |
| `#fcd34d` on `#fdecce` | 1.24 | warning badge |
| `#fb7185` / `#f4627d` / `#a78bfa` | 2.0–2.7 | badge tints |

Badges need a per-tone foreground/background token pair (one darkened foreground per tint), not a single global change. The opacity-derived greys need the `ink` blends raising or replacing with solid tokens.

**How to get the evidence:** `e2e/axe.spec.ts` now prints the exact failing colour pairs with ratios and font sizes. Run:

```bash
cd ~/AreenCUBs-Studio-staging && bash scripts/run-e2e.sh --project=desktop -g axe
```

Still outstanding for Phase 1: light AND dark theme verification, and fabricated-data screenshots at all three viewports.

### Then: Phase 2 — role schema and complete RLS matrix

Write the permission matrix first. Everything from Phase 3 onward depends on it.

### Totals at this commit

200 unit · 103 database · typecheck clean · build clean 52 routes. Axe still fails on the remaining tail (deliberately — real defects, not suppressed).

## Continuation point — 99f2240

### Phase 1 (contrast) — nearly complete

**Session result: 9 failing axe checks → 3; 1 passing → 7.** Desktop, light theme measured throughout; dark-theme pairs fixed as they surfaced.

Everything was fixed in the light-theme override block in `globals.css`, not in components. An early attempt changed the `--c-text-3` / `--c-cyan` custom properties and axe showed **no change at all** — those elements do not consume them. Always re-measure after a token edit.

Corrected this session:

| Was | Ratio | Now | Ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| `#6C8298` muted text | 3.97 | `#556575` | 5.99 |
| `#1A9DBF` accent | 2.92 | `#0E6C87` | 5.50 |
| `#7DD3FC` info badge | 1.48 | `#0A5680` | 7.04 |
| `#FCD34D` warning badge | 1.24 | `#7C4A02` | 6.37 |
| `#FB7185` danger badge | 2.07 | `#A11D36` | 5.89 |
| `#C4B5FD` violet badge | 2.72 | `#6D28D9` | 7.10 |
| `#4ADE80` success badge | 2.27 | `#166534` | 7.13 |
| `#38BDF8` | 2.14 | `#0A5680` | 7.91 |
| `#06B6D4` | 2.11 | `#0E6C87` | 5.21 |
| `#34D399` | 1.55 | `#166534` | 5.75 |
| `#3B8BBA` brand, light | 3.55 | `#1064D4` primary | 5.53 |
| `#3B8BBA` brand, dark | 3.76 | `#8FADCE` supporting | 6.09 |
| `#788591` dark muted | 3.88 | `#8FADCE` supporting | 6.32 |

`text-ink/50…70` alpha was also raised so the blend clears AA in light mode.

### Remaining — 3 single-node pairs

| Foreground | Background | Ratio |
|---|---|---|
| `#34d399` | `#ceedec` | 1.55 |
| `#94969c` | `#f5f9ff` | 2.79 |
| `#f4627d` | `#f5f0f7` | 2.71 |

All light-theme opacity blends whose originating class is not yet identified. `#34d399` is a *second* instance the class override did not catch, so it is set inline or via a different class.

**How to find them:** the axe artifacts record each failing node's DOM target.

```bash
cd ~/AreenCUBs-Studio-staging
bash scripts/run-e2e.sh --project=desktop -g axe
grep -r "target" e2e/.artifacts --include=error-context.md | head
```

Locate the component from the target selector rather than adding another blind global override.

### Still outstanding for Phase 1

- Tablet and mobile axe runs — only desktop was re-measured this session
- A full dark-theme sweep — dark pairs were fixed opportunistically as they surfaced
- Fabricated-data screenshots at 1280×720, 768×1024, 390×844

### Then: Phase 2 — role schema and complete RLS matrix

Write the permission matrix first. Everything from Phase 3 onward depends on it.
