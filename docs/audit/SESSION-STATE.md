# Session state

Written so another session can resume without reconstructing anything. Updated at every phase boundary.

---

## Where things stand

| | |
|---|---|
| Canonical repo | `C:\Users\AreenCubs\AreenCUBs-Studio` (source of truth) |
| Branch | `phase-1-data-integrity` |
| Isolated execution clone | `~/AreenCUBs-Studio-staging` inside Ubuntu / WSL 2 (ext4) |
| Local stack | **stopped** unless a phase is actively testing |
| Production contact | **never** — no query, no migration list, no push, no deploy |

**Sync rule:** the WSL clone is only ever a *runner*. Before any database or end-to-end verification, fast-forward it to the exact canonical commit:

```bash
wsl -d Ubuntu -u root -- bash -lc 'cd /root/AreenCUBs-Studio-staging && git fetch origin && git checkout -q <commit>'
```

`node_modules` is never shared between Windows and WSL. If `command -v npm` in WSL returns a `/mnt/c/...` path, the Linux toolchain is not being used.

---

## Infrastructure (already built, do not rebuild)

- WSL 2, Ubuntu, **NAT** networking (`.wslconfig` absent — defaults). Mirrored networking must never be enabled.
- Native **Docker Engine CE** inside Ubuntu, `unix:///var/run/docker.sock`, API never on TCP.
- `/etc/docker/daemon.json` pins `ip` and `default-network-opts.bridge.host_binding_ipv4` to `127.0.0.1`.
- Docker Desktop is installed but **stopped**, and its `daemon.json` was restored from backup. It cannot enforce loopback publishing on Windows — `db:preflight` now fails on it deliberately.

---

## Standing constraints

- Free and open-source only. No purchases, trials, or paid tiers.
- No production connection, remote query, `db push/pull/dump`, deployment, or Vercel change.
- Never read, print, copy or modify the Windows `.env.local`.
- No key, JWT, password or connection string in output, tests, fixtures, docs or Git.
- Synthetic `.invalid` users and fabricated business data only.
- Money module stays disconnected from persistence; financial behaviour unchanged.
- No new roles/permissions without an approved specification. No RLS weakening.
- Stop the stack whenever it is not actively under test.

---

## Resume checklist

```bash
cd /c/Users/AreenCubs/AreenCUBs-Studio
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD     # phase-1-data-integrity
git status --short                  # must be empty
npm run test:run                    # see AUTONOMOUS-PROGRESS.md for the current total
```

Then read, in order:

1. `docs/audit/AUTONOMOUS-PROGRESS.md` — what is done and what is next
2. `docs/audit/DECISIONS-NEEDED.md` — everything blocked on approval
3. `docs/audit/PHASE-0-DISCOVERY.md` — the confirmed issue register
4. `docs/STAGING.md` — how to run the isolated stack

---

## Next steps (in order)

1. **Phase 2d — browser/hydration verification.** Not started.
   - `npm i -D @playwright/test && npx playwright install chromium` (free)
   - Generate ephemeral local Supabase keys from `npm run db:status` into an **ignored** temp env file inside the WSL clone. Never print, never commit, delete afterwards.
   - Cover: synthetic admin login, missing-profile fail-closed, Content OS plan creation, Publishing hydration under UTC-server vs Africa/Tunis-browser, finance pages against the contradiction fixture, navigation and error states.
   - Responsive at mobile / tablet / desktop; focused a11y (keyboard, visible focus, labels, dialogs, contrast).
   - Screenshots must contain fabricated data only.
2. **Phase 2f — dashboard quality audit**, using 2d evidence.

Run database and browser work **only** inside WSL, prove isolation first, stop the stack after.

## Current totals

| | |
|---|---|
| Unit tests | **197** (8 files) — `npm run test:run`, no Docker needed |
| Database tests | **99** (4 files) — `npm run test:db`, requires the WSL stack |
| Build | clean, **52 routes** |
| Typecheck | clean |
